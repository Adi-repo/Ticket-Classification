1,PowerBI,Original,Issue with Power bi date slicer,"If you are experiencing an issue with the date slicer in Power BI, there could be several reasons why this is happening. Here are some common issues and their potential solutions:
1. The date slicer is not filtering data correctly: This could be due to incorrect data type or formatting of the date column in the data source. To resolve this issue, check the data type of the date column and ensure that it matches the format of the date slicer.
2. The date slicer is not displaying all the available dates: This could be due to the range of dates selected in the slicer. To resolve this issue, adjust the range of dates displayed in the slicer or increase the granularity of the slicer.
3. The date slicer is not working at all: This could be due to a corrupted Power BI file or a bug in the Power BI software. To resolve this issue, try restarting Power BI or creating a new file and recreating the date slicer.
4. The date slicer is not interacting with other visuals or filters: This could be due to the order of the visuals in the report page or incorrect interaction settings. To resolve this issue, adjust the order of the visuals or update the interaction settings to ensure that the date slicer is interacting with the desired visuals and filters.
If the issue persists, you may need to consult with a Power BI expert or Microsoft Support for further assistance."

7,PowerBI,Original,The date slicer is not filtering data correctly,"If your Power BI date slicer is not filtering data correctly, here are some possible solutions to try:
1. Check your data
2. Check your date hierarchy: Verify that your date hierarchy is set up correctly. If your date slicer is not filtering data correctly, it could be because the date hierarchy is not set up correctly. In Power BI, you can set up a date hierarchy by right-clicking on the date field in your data model and selecting ""New Hierarchy.""
3. Check your date slicer settings: Verify that the date slicer is set up correctly. Check the ""Filters"" pane to ensure that the slicer is set up to filter the correct data field.
4. Check the date range: Verify that the date range selected in the date slicer is correct. If you are not seeing the expected data, it could be because the date range is incorrect or too narrow.
5. Check your relationship between data tables: If your data model contains multiple tables, ensure that the tables are correctly related. Incorrect relationships between tables can cause data to be excluded or incorrectly filtered.
6. Refresh your data

85,PowerBI,Original,How to resolve the Power BI API token issue in the Azure ADFS Setup?,"The reason this is not working is by default Azure AD will block ROPC flow for a Federated account. This flow only works if you are using a cloud account (onmicrosoft.com domain) for security reasons. If you need to authenticate with a Federated account, it's better if you use the ADAL library. We have an ADAL Java library here.
https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-java/wiki/Acquiring-Tokens-with-username-and-password

Also, please note that:-
Microsoft recommends you do not use the ROPC flow. In most scenarios, more secure alternatives are available and recommended. This flow requires a very high degree of trust in the application, and carries risks which are not present in other flows. You should only use this flow when other more secure flows can't be used.

3. Check that the connection string is correct and properly formatted. The connection string should include the name of the storage account, the access key, and the container name.
4. Make sure that the storage account is properly configured to allow access using the access key. You can check this by ensuring that the access key is valid and has not expired.
5. Check that the credentials used to connect to the storage account have the necessary permissions to access the container. You can do this by checking the access policies in the container settings.
6. If you are using a virtual network (VNet) with your Azure Analysis Services instance, make sure that the VNet and the storage account are peered or connected via a VPN gateway.

If yes, then it is usual behaviour of Azure Analysis services where while refreshing the cubes, 2.5 times is the total memory in use approximately until the complete cube is refreshed.
